        <h2>Hi! Nice to meet you!</h2>
        <p>As an emerging UI designer I (<em>Love</em>) creating new content in many different digital formats. One of
            my favorite ways to make content
            is through fancy Canva graphics for different special events or holidays. My next two favorites are creating
            Interface designs with figma or websites with code.
            I hope you enjoy this portfolio I put together with Code to showcase my work.</p>

    <h3>Experience and Education</h3>
    <p>I've earned my Bachelor's in Strategic Communication- Social Media Management from Liberty University Online.
        After I graduated, I
        enrolled in a UI design bootcamp known as CareerFoundry. Here I learned all about Interface Design and even a
        little code. Directly
        after finishing, I enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development course through CodeAcademy.
        As for the experience side of things, I practiced my design skils through volunteering with a couple different
        non profits such as
        Yiddishland California and Dallas Pets Alive. Now i'm excited to work to obtain my first design position.
